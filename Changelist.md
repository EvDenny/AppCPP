# Changelist

## ./

- [x] ADDED CHANGELIST TO MAIN DIRECTORY (Changelist.md)

### main

#### App.cpp

- [x] REMOVED `clearInput()` FUNCTION FROM FILE AND MOVED TO `menu.h`

#### build.sh

#### clear.cpp

#### clear.h

#### Guess.cpp

#### Guess.h

#### mdy.cpp

- [x] COMMENTED OUT `Calendar::check()` FUNCTION BASED ON COMPLEXITY ISSUE ON CodeFactor
- [x] CREATED TWO NEW FUNCTIONS (BOTH WITH THE NAMESPACE `Calendar::`) `checkInput()` AND `checkFinish()`
- [x] THE FORMER FUNCTION IS ONLY USED ONCE RIGHT AFTER ALL INPUTS ARE COMPLETED BY THE USER TO TEST WHETHER TO USE THE FORWARD OR BACKWARD MAINLOOP
- [x] THE LATTER FUNCTION IS USED OFTEN IN METHODS LIKE `nextYear()`, `prevMonth()`, and `nextDay()` TO CHECK WHEN THE INPUT DATE IS REACHED BY THE MAINLOOP

##### mdy_dupe.cpp

- [x] DUPLICATE OF `mdy.cpp` FOR TESTING REDUCTION OF GLOBAL VARIABLES. RESULTS ARE YET TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND FILE HAS BEEN COMMENTED OUT FOR SAFETY.

#### mdy.h

#### vectors.cpp

- [x] NEW FILE!
- [x] ABSORBED COMPLEX FUNCTIONS FROM `vectors.h`
- [ ] RUN TESTS ON FUNCTIONS. RECEIVING ERRORS IN REGARDS TO THE `std::remove` FUNCTION. SPECIFICALLY IT MAY REQUIRE A VECTOR ITERATOR AS A FIRST PARAMETER RATHER THAN THE `vector.begin()` IN ALL INSTANCES IN THE FILE.

#### vectors.h

- [x] MOVED COMPLEX VECTOR-BASED METHODS TO `vectors.cpp`
- [x] LEFT LESS COMPLEX (ONE-LINERS) ALONE BUT ADDED *inline* TAG FOR INCREASED PERFORMANCE
- [x] `struct Equalto` MOVED TO BEGINNING OF FILE

#### Sleep.h

- [x] ADDED *inline* TAG TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH CLASS METHOD

#### hang.cpp

- [x] APPENDED `using namespace std;` TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE FOR REDUCING THE REPETITION OF `std::` NAMESPACE

#### menu.h

- [x] MOVED `clearInput()` FUNCTION FROM `App.cpp` TO THIS FILE OR COMPATIBILITY ACROSS ALL FILES
- [x] LEARNED THAT USING `std::cin.clear();` BEFORE `std::cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');` IS THE CORRECT WAY TO PREVENT THE INFINITE LOOP BUG WITH `switch` STATEMENTS AND NON-INTEGER INPUTS.

### WIP Directory

- [x] CREATED NEW FILE FOR RNG TOOL (`rngGen.cpp/rngGen.exe`)
- [ ] MOVE TO CORRECT FOLDER ONCE CLASSES AND OBJECTS ARE SET FOR MERGING WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
- [x] JSON FILE FOR CUSTOMIZABLE USER RANGES FOR RNG (`rng.json`)
- [x] `file.txt` IS CURRENTLY DEMO FILE FOR `<fstream>` FILE EDITING AND PARSING
  - [ ] SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE WAYS TO SAVE CONDITIONS FOR USING APP IN THE FUTURE
  - [x] ABLE TO PRINT UTF-8 STYLE ARRAY BY UNICODE NUMBER. 
      - [x] `VectorProgram()` WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PRINT ASCII CHARACTERS BASED ON NUMBERS IN AN ARRAY

#### WIP/hangman

- [x] CREATED TESTING ENVIRONMENT FOR NEW `hang.h/hang.cpp` FILES IN main REPOSITORY
- [x] ADDS COMPLEXITY TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION WHERE EACH DRAWING WAS A SEPARATE FUNCTION WHICH LED TO A LOT OF REPETITION
- [x] CREATES FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THE `draw(int lives)` FUNCTION BY MAKING THE DRAWING USE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS FOR THE HEAD, TORSO, AND LEGS.
  - [x] EACH DRAWS THE APPROPRIATE SYMBOLS AT EACH RESPECTIVE 'Y' VALUE FOR THE NUMBER OF LIVES REMAINING.
  - [ ] INCORPORATE THIS NEW IDEA INTO `hangman.cpp` BY REPLACING `hang.h/hang.cpp`

#### WIP/scribe/scribe.cpp & scribe0.cpp & scribe_brainstorm.cpp

- [ ] ATTEMPTED TO RECREATE PYTHON SCRIBE CHALLENGE IN C++ (PROVING QUITE DIFFICULT TO WRAP HEAD AROUND)

#### WIP/TTT&testing

- [x] CREATED `test.cpp` AND `test.exe` TO BEGIN TESTING METHODOLOGY FOR TIC TAC TOE GAME
