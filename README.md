# AppCPP
C++ Application Programming. Currently a work in progress on a single app to test my milestones in learning C++ programming. Including demonstrations of my skills and examples of my abilities to problem solve and implement solutions to self-assigned tasks including creating games, tools, and using C++ APIs like OpenGL and SFML.
